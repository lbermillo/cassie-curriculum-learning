Research on Locomotion Curriculum Learning for Cassie based on Infant Motor Development

1. Posture is the foundation upon which actions are built  
    * Having a good posture provides a stable base for locomotion  
    * Must be sufficiently stable to allow movements of the extremities  
    * Development of posture control leads to a cascade of new skills  
    * Perceptually guided and maintained   
2. Infants often learn how to stand and balance before locomotion  
    * Control proficiency runs from top to bottom on infants, increasing control down the spine (neck, shoulders, waist, and hips)  
    * Locomotion appears only after infants can keep balance in one place  
    * Transitions between postures (prone to sitting, sitting to standing, standing to walking, etc.) typically emerge last  
3. Locomotion (Walking)  
    * Newborns move their legs in an alternating pattern that resembles walking  
      - Can ‘air-step’ without an eliciting physical stimulus 
      - Can deliberately modify leg movements in various configuration (alternating, simultaneous, and single-leg kicks)  
    * Walking  
      - First steps are wobbly and uneven  
    * Locomotion is a creative process and infants must learn to control locomotion adaptively  
4. Practice  
    * Infants  accumulate immense amount of practice (about 2400 steps in an hour)  
    * Rapid improvement occurs when infants discover relevant parameters that control upright balance and propulsion
